This repository contains explanations and implementations of Logistic Regression and Multiple Linear Regression, two fundamental algorithms in machine learning used for classification and regression tasks, respectively.
About
This repository aims to explain and demonstrate the core concepts behind Logistic Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.

Logistic Regression is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a binary outcome (e.g., success/failure, yes/no).
Multiple Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables, allowing for the prediction of continuous outcomes.
Both algorithms are widely used in machine learning and data analysis tasks.

Logistic Regression
Theory
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for binary classification. It is used when the target variable is binary (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false). The logistic regression model uses a logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to estimate the probability of a class label.
Implementation
You can implement logistic regression using libraries like scikit-learn, or you can code it from scratch using gradient descent to find the optimal weights. Below is an example of implementing logistic regression using Python's scikit-learn.

  Logistic Regression for Housing Program
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict housing-related outcomes, such as whether a house is affordable or not, based on various features like location, size, price, and amenities.
